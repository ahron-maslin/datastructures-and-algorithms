# datastructures-and-algorithms
taken from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM, and rewritten in c

My main goal with this is to get a better understanding in datastructures and algorithms, as well as a more experience in C.  

## Testing
To test all the files run ```make all```, then ```make test```. It should (hopefully) print out "All tests pass!" for each program.


## More Stuff / Changelog??
- this project is a mess but I'm publishing it anyway. I tried to cram in as much randomness as possible, and therefore there is no continuity with macros, definitions, typedefs, etc.
Someday I hope to clean it all up, but if any of you want to submit a PR, I would be happy to merge. Until then it'll remain a mess...
- You can now run ```make <target>``` with an environmental variable `D` set to anything, and it will compile in debugging mode.
