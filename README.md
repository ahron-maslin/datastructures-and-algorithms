# datastructures-and-algorithms
taken from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM, and rewritten in c

My main goal with this is to get a better understanding in datastructures and algorithms, as well as a more experience in C.  

## Testing
To test all the files run ```make all```, then ```make test```. It should (hopefully) print out "All tests pass!" for each program.
